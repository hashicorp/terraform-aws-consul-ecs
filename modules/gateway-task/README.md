# Mesh Task

This module deploys an application task as part of the service mesh.
It is designed so you can easily modify existing [`ecs_task_definition`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ecs_task_definition)
resources to use this module instead.

See https://www.consul.io/docs/ecs for additional documentation.
