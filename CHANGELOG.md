## Unreleased
BREAKING CHANGES
* modules/mesh-task: `execution_role_arn` and `task_role_arn` variables have been removed.
  The mesh-task now creates those roles and instead accepts `additional_task_role_policies`
  and `additional_execution_role_policies` to modify the execution and task roles and allow
  more permissions. [[GH-19](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul-ecs/pull/19)]
